1. In this project we are going to do api call to take in data
2. we are going to make here custom hooks
3. we will see how to optimize the webpage for performance
hooks in majority of cases return js only, so make it in a .js file


  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

a hook basically returns an array containing a variable and a fxn
custom hooks can use the builtin hooks also

whenever make a custom hook start its name with use: it is a professional rule

koi basic fxn jo js return kr rha ha is a custom hook

we can take api calls from open source projects


mostly data from api calles is never received in json but always in string format...so we need to convert them to json...so reactQuery,axios handles them by default

--------------------
.then() is called when the Promise is successfully resolved.
.catch() is called when the Promise is rejected (an error occurs).


//app.jsx

. New Props Introduced
ðŸ†• amount
It is the value shown in the <input> box.

It is a controlled input, meaning its value is fully controlled by React state.

ðŸ†• onAmountChange
It is a callback function.

It is called when the user types something in the input box.

It passes the numeric value (Number(e.target.value)) back to the parent component.

ðŸ†• onCurrencyChange
Callback function for when user selects a different currency from the dropdown.

ðŸ†• currencyOption = []
It is an array of currency options (like ["usd", "inr", "eur"]).

It will be mapped to <option> elements for the <select> dropdown (though not yet used â€” currently hardcoded as just one usd).

ðŸ†• selectCurrency = "usd"
The currently selected currency in the dropdown. Also controlled by React state.

Default value is "usd".

ðŸ†• amountDisable = false, currencyDisable = false
These control whether the input and dropdown should be disabled (i.e., not editable).
The disabled property of an HTML <input> element or a <label> element is used to indicate that the element is not interactive or cannot be modified by the user.  

Useful if you want to lock the input under certain conditions.
